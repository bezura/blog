# How I spent the past week
Hi friends, I want to tell you how I spent my week in my hometown. It was wonderful!

On Friday I visited my family and we had a long chat over dinner. They were very happy to see me and gave me a warm welcome.

On Saturday, I met up with my friends from school. We gathered at our favorite cafe and talked over a cup of coffee. We exchanged our experiences, laughed at old jokes, and reminisced about our adventures and dreams. We also visited our school and our classroom teacher.

On Sunday, I spent the day outdoors with my family. We went for a picnic by the river. The weather was beautiful: sunny, warm and refreshing. We enjoyed the beauty of nature, rode our bikes, played ball, fished, and swam in the river.

On Monday, I started getting ready to leave. I packed my things, gave my family souvenirs from the city where I study, and thanked them for all they do for me.

I am so glad I was able to visit my hometown and spend time with my loved ones. It was one of the most memorable and enjoyable weeks of my life!
