# **What is Markdown**

**Markdown** is a text markup language created by writer and blogger John Gruber. It's designed to create beautifully formatted text in regular TXT files. You don't need a cumbersome word processor like Word or Pages to create documents with bold or italic type, quotations, links, and even tables. All you need to do is memorize the simple rules of Markdown and you can even write in Notepad. A dedicated Markdown editor is a good idea.

It is a markup language used by bloggers, writers, editors and journalists all over the world. Everyone involved in those professions will find it useful to know about it.

#*Where you can use Markdown

## Notes

A **Markdown** editor with a file panel (like Atom or iA Writer) is a pretty decent alternative to Evernote and OneNote. We've written before about why Markdown is good for organizing your note base.

## Drafts for Blogging

This markup language is compatible with a bunch of online editors and blogging platforms. You can write a draft for your blog in Markdown and then publish it in seconds - all the links, headings, and formatting will look just as you intended. It's not like copying from Word.

## Task Lists

Markdown editors make it very easy to create shopping lists, to-do lists, and work task lists. Some geeks use a regular todo.txt text file as an alternative to fancy Wunderlist and Todoist. You can learn how to do this at Todo.txt.

## Messengers

Even some messengers support Markdown. In Telegram, for example, you can use Markdown to apply bold or italic highlighting.

## The advantages of Markdown

## Versatility

Documents written using the Markdown syntax are plain TXT text files. They can be opened on any platform and in any editor. This makes them different from text processor files. Have you ever tried opening an Apple Pages document in Word?

## Simplicity

Markdown is so simple that even people who haven't heard of Latex and HTML can learn it in 10 minutes. Grids for subheadings, asterisks for highlighting, dashes for lists. It couldn't be easier.

## A wide range of tools ##

There are many, many editors for Markdown documents. There are online, mobile, and desktop tools. There is the monster Atom, the beautiful and minimalistic ghostwriter and iA Writer, Vim for geeks and Ulysses for professional writers. Take your pick.

## Convertibility.

Markdown documents can be easily exported in any format such as PDF, DOC and ODT. Their formatting remains unchanged.
